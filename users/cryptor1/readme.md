### Files

The goal was to build a common userspace that can house keymap 'chunks' that can be maintained flashed to various my keyboards (above). This userspace contains separate files for:
- Shared keymap 'chunks' that can be maintained in this userspace and flashed to multiple keyboards
    - Goal is to have the same keymap across 3 different, ortholinear keyboards
- Various macros
- Encoder functions:
    - single encoder functions for Planck and Preonic
    - dual encoder functions for Iris
- Tap Dance functions
- Shared config, rules.mk, and layers
